// Priority Operators
// 1st  * / %            for associativity left to right 
// 2nd  + -
// 3rd   =
// Operators of higher priority are evaluated first in the absence of parenthesis.


// ðŸ”¥    OPERATOR ASSOCIATIVITY
// When operators of equal priority are present in an expression, the tie is taken care of by
// associativity.
//          x*y/z â†’ (x*y)/z
//          x/y*z â†’ (x/y)*z
// (*, / follows left to right associativity)
// Pro Tip: Always use parenthesis in case of confusion
